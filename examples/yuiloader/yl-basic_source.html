<h1>YUI Loader Utility Example: Loading the YUI Calendar Control with the YUI Loader Utility</h1>

<p>In this example, we bring a YUI component onto the page using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/loader/">YUI Loader Utility</a>. This example implements YUI Loader via the <code>YAHOO_config</code> object.  We load the YUI Loader script file, then specify in <code>YAHOO_config</code> which component we want loaded on the page &mdash; and what we want to do once it <em>is</em> loaded.</p>

<div id="calendar_container"></div>

<script>
YAHOO_config = {

	//we don't have loader on the page, so we'll use our
	//"listener" to log to the console if supported by the 
	//browser.  "listener" is a method that will be fired
	//by the YAHOO Global Object each time a new YUI module
	//is successfully loaded.
	listener: function(moduleInformation) {
		//if(console) {console.log(moduleInformation);}
	}, 
	
	//the "load" member of YAHOO_config is where we provide
	//information to the YUI Loader Utility about what components
	//we want to load, where they exist, and what to do once
	//they're loaded.
	load: {
		require: ['calendar'], //what components?
		base: '../../build/', //where do they live?
		//loadOptional: true, //load all optional dependencies?
		//filter: "DEBUG", 	//use debug versions (or apply some
							//some other filter?

		//onLoadComplete is the function that YUI Loader
		//should call when all components are successfully loaded.
		onLoadComplete: function(loader) {
		
			//Once the YUI Calendar Control and dependencies are on
			//the page, we'll verify that our target container is 
			//available in the DOM and then instantiate a default
			//calendar into it:
			YAHOO.util.Event.onAvailable("calendar_container", function() {
				var myCal = new YAHOO.widget.Calendar("mycal_id", "calendar_container");
				myCal.render();
			})
		}
	}
}
</script>

<!--Having created our YAHOO_config object, we now load the YUI
    Loader Utility; it will consume the object and follow the 
	instructions we provided there.-->
