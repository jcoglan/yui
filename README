YUI 3.0.0 PR1

This is a preview release of a subset of the components under development for YUI 3.0.  
This is not production quality software.  It is an early distribution released so that 
the team can get some early feedback on the direction we are taking in the development 
of the next major revision to the library.

The release includes the core components:
     - YUI  (global object)
     - Node
     - Event
The functionality provided by YUIâ€™s 3.x Core had previously been covered in the 
YAHOO Global Object, Dom, and Event components in the 2.x releases.

In addition, the following infrastructure components have been added:
    - Base     
    - Attribute

The following list outlines the utilities that have been included in this release.  
Many are enhanced versions migrated from the 2.x library.
    - Animation
    - Cookie
    - Drag & Drop
    - Get
    - IO (formerly Connection Manager)
    - JSON
    - Queue (yielding utility making use of timeout chains)

In addition, updated versions of the CSS components are also available
    - CSS Base
    - CSS Reset 
    - CSS Fonts
    - CSS Grids
These components are evolutions of the CSS foundation found in YUI 2.x.

The YUI 3.x website is located at  http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/.  You will find 
more detailed documentation of these components there as well as number of examples 
demonstrating their use.
