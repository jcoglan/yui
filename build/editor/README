**** version 2.3.1 ***

* New methods were added (show and hide) that need to be called when the Editor is placed inside an element that will be set to display: none.
    For example: Placing an Editor inside of a TabView or Panel. You should now hook into the other widgets show/hide event and call myEditor.show() or myEditor.hide() when needed.
* Dependency on the full Container family was removed, you can now use only the container-core package.
* The editor CSS has changed to allow for easier customizing.
* The CSS patch that was issued for the 2.3.0 release of the Editor should be removed when installing 2.3.1.
* Safari performace issue: If you are experiencing extreme performance issues with Safari
    (keys taking a long time to respond, enter key not working, CPU spiking).
    Please check to see if you have AcidSearch from pozytron.com installed.
    It has been determined that the latest release if AcidSearch is interfering
    with the Rich Text Editor. Currently the only solution is to un-install
    the plugin. The maker of AcidSearch has been notified of the issue and should respond soon.

**** version 2.3.0 ***

* Beta release.

* Known Issues
    * All
        1. Removed the menu for Create Ordered Lists, it now defaults to creating a simple OL with no type.
     
    * Safari
        1. Bug #1390926 - Safari may not inject the editor's HTML into the text area when the config handleSubmit is set to true.
            You can get around this with the following code (where comment is the id of the textarea):
                YAHOO.util.Dom.setStyle('comment', 'visibility', 'hidden');
                YAHOO.util.Dom.setStyle('comment', 'position', 'absolute');
                YAHOO.util.Dom.setStyle('comment', 'display', 'block');
                oEditor.saveHTML();
                window.setTimeout(function() {
                        YAHOO.util.Dom.get('comment').form.submit();
                }, 200);

            This issue will be fixed in a later release..
        2. Unable to get the cursor position inside the editable area.
            What this means is that when an image/object is inserted into the document
            we have no way of knowing "exactly" where to put it. So we make an educated guess.
            If they user clicked on an "element" (HTML Element) in the editor, then we will place
            the newly inserted element directly after it in the DOM. If there was no element clicked
            We will append the new element to the body.

        3. Ordered/Unorder Lists are not support natively. So we have built a work around for this.
            Most browsers will allow you to select a block of text and create a list out of it "automagically"
            by inserting an LI around blocks that are separated by line breaks, BRs or Ps. In Safari, the 
            entire text block will be turned into the first LI of the list. The user can then place the cursor
            at the beginning of each line, and backspace, then hit enter to create the new list item. There are some
            use cases that this might fail.

        4. Dragging and dropping of selections and images/objects is not supported.
            Safari will do some weird things if the text in the editable area is selected and dragged and dropped.
            We prevent this from happening to images inside of the editable area, but we can not prevent it for text.
            Safari will also give unexpected results if text from another Safari window in selected, then dragged
            into the editable area.

    * Opera
        1. Placing the cursor in the editor, then Shift Clicking to highlight will not work. The limitation appear to be in Opera.

        2. Image resize is unavailable, due to limitations in the browser

        3. Shortcut keys are not supported in this release.

        4. Dragging and dropping of selections and images/objects is not supported.

        5. Hitting the back button on the page will not reload the iframe.

        6. Selecting the editable area, then hitting the shortcut keys for "Reload" will
            cause the current page to be displayed inside the editable area.


**** version 2.3.0 Peview Release Notes ***

* The only server side resource required to run the editor, is the blankimage file.
    The blankimage file is the temporary image loaded into the editor when you click the
    "Insert Image" button in the toolbar.

    This can be set using:

    var myEditor = new YAHOO.widget.Editor('test', {
        blankimage: 'MY_IMAGE_PATH'
    });

* There is a performance issue with Safari on a G4 computer. We will be working to get this resolved before the initial beta release.
